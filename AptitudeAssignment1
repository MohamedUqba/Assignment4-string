5. Income of A & B is in ratio 2:3. For example, if B’s income is Rs 3000, find
out the ratio of their expenditures if their savings are Rs 500 & Rs 700,
respectively.



Answers:

1-The equations x=2 and y=4 meet at the point (2, 4).

2-The system of equations 2X + 3Y = 9 and 7X + 9Y = -6 has a 
	unique solution. This is because the system has two equations 
	with two variables (X and Y) and the determinant of the coefficient 
	matrix is non-zero. Therefore, the lines represented by the equations 
	intersect at a single point.

3-The equation 7x + 9y = -5 represents a linear equation in two variables,
	 x and y. It has infinitely many solutions. This is because it represents 
	 a line in the xy-plane, and any point lying on that line is a solution to 
	 the equation. The equation does not have a unique solution.

4-If the coefficients a, b, and c in the quadratic 
	equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 are all zero (a = b = c = 0), 
	then the equation becomes 0x^2 + 0x + 0 = 0. In this case,
	 the equation is satisfied for all values of x. It represents an 
	 identity rather than an equation with a specific solution. 
	 In other words, it is true for every value of x.

5-The income ratio of A to B is given as 2:3. If B's income is
	 Rs 3000, the income of A can be calculated using the given ratio.

	The income ratio of A to B is 2:3, which means A's income is (2/3) times the income of B.
	So, A's income = (2/3) * B's income = (2/3) * Rs 3000 = Rs 2000.

	Given that the savings of A and B are Rs 500 and Rs 700 respectively, we can find the ratio of their expenditures.
	Expenditure of A = Income of A - Savings of A = Rs 2000 - Rs 500 = Rs 1500.
	Expenditure of B = Income of B - Savings of B = Rs 3000 - Rs 700 = Rs 2300.

	Therefore, the ratio of their expenditures is 1500:2300, which can be simplified as 15:23.
