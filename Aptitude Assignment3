    Equation 1: ax^2 + bx + c = 0
    Equation 2: dx^2 + ex + f = 0
    
    Sum of roots = -b/a + (-e/d) = 2 * (Product of roots) = 2 * (c/a) * (f/d)
    
    we can write the following equations:
    -b/a - e/d = 2 * (c/a) * (f/d)
    Simplifying the equation:
    
    -bd - ae = 2cf
    
    two quadratic equations that satisfy this equation:
    Equation 1: x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0
    Equation 2: 2x^2 + 4x + 2 = 0
      
      In Equation 1, the sum of roots is -3 and the product of roots is 2, which satisfies the condition: -3 = 2 * 2.
      
      In Equation 2, the sum of roots is -2 and the product of roots is 1, which also satisfies the condition: -2 = 2 * 1.

  To check if (2,3) is a solution to the equation 2x + 3y = 12, we substitute the values of x and y into the equation:
  2(2) + 3(3) = 4 + 9 = 13

  Since 13 is not equal to 12, (2,3) is not a solution to the equation 2x + 3y = 12.

  To find the possible coordinates (x, y) such that the points (1,1), (2,2), and (x,y) are collinear, we need to determine if the slope between any two points is equal to the slope between the other two points.
  The slope between (1,1) and (2,2) is (2 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 1 / 1 = 1.
  For points (1,1) and (x,y), the slope is (y - 1) / (x - 1).
  To maintain collinearity, the slope between (1,1) and (x,y) should be 1.
  we have (y - 1) / (x - 1) = 1.
  Cross-multiplying, we get y - 1 = x - 1. Simplifying, y = x.
  Therefore, any coordinates (x, y) where y = x will satisfy the condition and make the points collinear.

  We want to find all possible values of a and b such that the ratio of a^3 + b^3 to a^3 - b^3 is 1:1. 
  (a^3 + b^3) / (a^3 - b^3) = 1/1
  Cross-multiplying, we have a^3 + b^3 = a^3 - b^3.
  Simplifying, 2b^3 = 0.
  From this equation, we can conclude that b must be 0 in order to satisfy the condition.
  Therefore, for any real value of a and b = 0, the ratio of a^3 + b^3 to a^3 - b^3 will be 1:1.

  To find the area of the triangle formed by the lines y = x, the y-axis, and y = 3, 
  we need to determine the length of the base and the height of the triangle.
  The base of the triangle is the line segment between the y-axis and the point where y = 3. 
  This occurs when x = 0. Therefore, the length of the base is 3 units.
  The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from the line y = x to the line y = 3.
  This distance is the difference between the y-intercepts of the two lines, which is 3 - 0 = 3 units.
  Now, we can calculate the area of the triangle using the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2.
  Plugging in the values, we get: Area = (3 * 3) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5 square units.
  Therefore, the area of the triangle formed by the lines y = x, the y-axis, and y = 3 is 4.5 square units.
