Questions:

1. What quantity of water should be added to the milk water mixture so that
	the milk water ratio changes from 2:3 to 4:11. The quantity of milk in the
	mixture is 40 litres?
2. Linear equation 2x+3y=0 meets the x & y-axis at the point?

3. a & b are positive integers such that a^2-b^=19. Find a & b?

4. Find a^+b^3+c^3+3abc , where a+b+c=5 & , a^2+b^2+c^2=10?

5. Sum of two, two-digit numbers is a perfect square. The digits of the first
	two-digit number are two consecutive positive integers; also, when the digits
	of the first number are reversed, the second number is formed. Find these
	numbers & the square root of their sum.



Answers:

1- 120 = (11/15) * (40 + W)
	120 * 15 = 11 * (40 + W)
	1800 = 440 + 11W
	11W = 1800 - 440
	11W = 1360
	W = 1360 / 11

	Therefore, the quantity of water that should be added to the milk-water mixture is approximately 123.64 liters.
	
2- The linear equation 2x + 3y = 0 meets the x-axis and y-axis at 
	the origin (0, 0). This is because when x = 0, the equation 
	simplifies to 3y = 0, giving y = 0. Similarly, when y = 0, 
	the equation simplifies to 2x = 0, giving x = 0.
	 the line represented by the equation intersects both the x-axis and the y-axis at the point (0, 0).
